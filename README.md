# CogNOS in a nutshell

This repo contains a nopsys-style version of the Cog VM. That means a Cog VM that runs a Squeak/Pharo/Cuis image without an OS. For more information on the nopsys library visit  https://github.com/nopsys/nopsys.

CogNOS is actually a third iteration of the orginal SqueakNOS project born at early 2000's. SqueakNOS had two previous stages. 
At a first stage, [Gerardo Richarte]() (Richie) and [Luciano Notarfrancesco]() depicted the fundamentals of the project 
and built its basis. Most of the code contained in this and related repositories was developed by them. 
The sources of that stage of the project can be found at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/squeaknos/.

In a second stage, during 2011-2012, [Javier Pim√°s](https://github.com/melkyades) and [Guido Chari](https://github.com/charig), in collaboration with Richie revived the project and made it compatible with Pharo Smalltalk. In addition, we added Filesystem (FAT32) and Memory Management (paging) support. This made it possible to snapshot images, an important milestone of the project. There is a blog with some documentation, the news of those days, and instructions to download prebuilt images: http://squeaknos.blogspot.com.ar/.

Now, we are working in a second revival! Smalltalk VMs (and also images) have changed a lot since the old times. 
We have decided to give a new name to the project: CogNOS since  we do not want the project to be tightly coupled to any particular Smalltalk dialect. 

## Using CogNOS
We provide a release version in the form of a [compressed file](../../releases/latest). To run it you need a virtual machine software install in your OS. Currently we provide support for:
* VirtualBox
* VMWare
* Qemu
* Bochs

Choose whichever you prefer. We recommend virtualbox since it is free, multiplatform, and is the fastest solution. Qemu and Bochs are much slower, but at the same time they provide much more low-level debugging facilities in case you need them.

So to run CogNOS just uncompress the file, enter the CogNOS directory and run: `./run.sh vbox`. Change vbox for qemu, bochs or vmware to change the VM software.  

## Building CogNOS
Beyond a release version we also provide support for the whole toolchain for developer. Our goals is to make this a *push one button* process. So everything that is eventually needed for building the project has already been put in the CogNOS repository.

Thanks to Travis CI, all commits of this repository are tested to check that the development toolchain is working under the linux platform. We are working to do the same for OSx.
The current build status is: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nopsys/CogNOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CogNOS/CogNOS). If status is *passing* and you have any problem in your setting, we suggest to search in the travis builds what you are missing. 


### Fetching and building artifacts

To build CogNOS you will need several artifacts:

- the sources of `opensmalltalk-vm` and the sources of `nopsys` - to build a `Cog` VM with the needed adaptations to be linkable to the nopsys library
- a `64-bit spur squeak/pharo/cuis NOS image` - this image will contain the "OS" drivers and will act as the OS when linked to nopsys. 
- a `64-bit squeak vmmaker image` - this is needed only to translate SqueakNOS slang plugin to C for generate the special VM sources to run in the bare metal.
- a compiled `64-bit cog vm` - to be able to run the image for generating the sources you need an already working Cog VM.

Below we describe how to automatically generate all the needed artifacts. 

<!--
- a `nopsys` repo - will provide the infrastructure to build a basic libnopsys, link it with the Cog VM and generate a bootable ISO image. Also will let us run the ISO image in a system VM like VirtualBox or QEMU.
-->


#### 1. Checkout CogNOS:

    git clone https://github.com/nopsys/CogNOS.git
<!--    git submodule update --init --recursive -->

The CogNOS repo contains the scripts that will download all other artifacts.

#### 2. Setup the repo, both for building and development:

    bash scripts/setupRepo.sh
    
This script will download and configure all the needed smalltalk images and a compiled VM to run them.

#### 3. Install dependencies (for making a bootable iso):

    sudo apt install grub-pc-bin xorriso
    
[Click here](Documentation/buildOSx.md) for dependency instructions in OSx      


#### 4. Build CogNOS:

Currently, this consists of two steps: 
1. Translating Slang sources to C 
2. Build them. 

For the first step you can just run `./scripts/buildSources.sh`. By default this will generate the jit version of a Spur Cog 64 bits VM. In case you prefer to work with an interpret just run `./scripts/buildSources.sh interpreter`.

Alternatively, you can generate the source manually. This means open the VMMaker image from a terminal, like this:

    cd opensmalltalk-vm/image
    
    ./sqlinux.201805090836/squeak BuildCogNOS.image (on linux)
or
    ./Squeak64.201805090836.app/Contents/MacOS/Squeak (on OSX)

You'll find a workspace there. You need to execute these two lines:

    VMMaker generateSqueakNOS64VM (VMMaker generateSqueakNOS64Stack, for the interpreter version)
    VMMaker generateSqueakNOSPlugins

If asked about overwriting files, just answer yes. You can quit the image without saving. 

Now, we are ready for the second step, to build everything: 

    cd ../opensmalltalk-vm/platforms/nopsys
    make  # builds vm.obj
    
and create a bootable media file:

    make iso # builds libnopsys.lib, links it to vm.obj and generates a bootable ISO image
    make hd  # builds libnopsys.lib, links it to vm.obj and generates a hard-disk image

#### 5. Try it

We support _all_ main system vms available: qemu, VirtualBox, 
VMWare and Bochs. You can even run the image with an attached gdb (through qemu)

    make try-qemu       # runs it using qemu
    make try-qemudbg    # runs it using qemu attaching a gdb to debug remotely and with symbols!!!
    make try-bochs      # runs it using bochs
    make try-virtualbox # runs it using VirtualBox
    make try-vmware     # runs it using WMWare player


Depending on the kind of work you want to do, we suggest using different VMs. For trying it, VirtualBox
is the fastest. If you want to debug Cog VM, we suggest using qemu which, while not as fast as VB,
is open, easy to install and lightweight. It installs with:

    sudo apt install qemu

To try it with a hard-disk image instead of a CD, call make with STORAGE=hd, like this:

    make try-vmware STORAGE=hd


### How to debug low level problems

Debugging smalltalk code is easy when you have a smalltalk browser available, but low
level problems just break the VM so it is harder to understand what is going on.
A few tips go here:

 - There are basically two low debugging workflows: `make try-bochs` and `make try-qemudbg`.
   With bochs you get extreme low level information (i.e. you can see the IDT, GDT, PT), but
   you can't see C code, emulation is slow and the debugging cli is pretty basic. With qemu
   you loose low level details but in exchange you get a full blown GDB console. We recommend
   using qemudbg unless looking for _really_ basic and low level errors.

 - To launch `qemudbg` you'll have to adjust a _magic_ number in the `Makefile` ;). This is because
   of a problem with `gdb`. If `gdb` connected directly, it would see code running in 32-bit mode, and then 
   when switching to long mode (64 bits) it will go crazy. Our workaround is to connect after a few
   seconds of simulation (to guarantee that `gdb` only sees 64 bits mode). To do this you have to go to the
   `Makefile` in `opensmalltalk-vm/platforms/nopsys` and change the `sleep` line to some value according
   to the speed of your machine. Waiting ~6 seconds is usually enough.

 - When using `qemudbg`, it will pause execution after connection. You'll have to manually continue
   execution. You can use that pause to place a few breakpoints. It can be useful to put a break in
   `warning` so that it pauses each time an assertion fails.

 - If you focus on the cli and press `ctrl+c`, execution will pause. There you can execute things like
   `bt` to print the C stack, or even something like `p printCallStack()` to show the smalltalk call
   stack (this may or may not work depending on the instant on which the VM got paused, you may have to try a
   few times, rebooting each time).

 - If you want, from smalltalk code, to show a message in the low-level console, you can just use
   this: `Computer show: aString`
    
## Contributing

There are two ways of contributing. At the image level or at the VM level.

### Image-level contributions
This is the standard way of contributing. Usually most users will work only at the image level. If all your contributions live at the image side then you could just make a pull request of smalltalk code to the SqueakNOS repository. Note that by default, the official nopsys git repository is configured in the Iceberg git tool. You should update that to your own clone to be able to push and then submit a pull request.

### VM-level contributions

Modifications and additions to the Cog VM in CogNOS follow the standard Squeak development process: there is a plugin written in Slang (SqueakNOSPlugin) which is used to generate the corresponding C code from an Smalltalk image.   
So, if you are working with some very low-level features, found low-level bugs, or just would like to propose a new primitive you will need to change the Slang code. 

Under the [image](https://github.com/nopsys/opensmalltalk-vm/tree/Cog/image) folder you will find an image compressed in a zip that already have everything necessary to generate the sources for both the VM itself and all the plugins. The development images are Squeak Smalltalk images. At the time of writing, they were the only supported images for developing open-smalltalk.
So to open the image and generate the sources see the previous section #4. Build CogNOS. The image should contain the latest released version of the SqueakNOSPlugin. 

<!--In case you would like to generate a completely fresh image with everything up to date, try (again, we are not in charge of the open-smalltalk. Usually the repo is stable but a few times we found that the build process was not up to date so, good luck! :) ):

    ./buildSpurTrunk64Image.sh-->

### How to collaborate
We will create issues, here in github, with different degrees of complexity...

<!--
### Things to figure out if you have time: 

 - I really don't know why PharoV50.sources is needed, but without it the build script fails, so you have to download it by hand as in the instructions above. 
 - It would be great to know the minimal amount of apt package dependencies, if you have time to check that would be great.
 - When opening a Pharo 6 image a message window says it is an old VM, but things seem to work. We need to check what's the problem there.
